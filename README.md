# colab Experiments Dependancy
Adding data and package to google colab experiments.

When working with google colab, usually you need to copy data, clone GitHub repos, or install some pip packages. If you need to run multiple experiments with the same data and set of packages, it will be a hassle to do that at every new notebook.

The colabExDep will read the data and package dependencies from a JSON file and copy/install the requirements.
